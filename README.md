# DQN-tensorflow
Implementation of Reinforcement Learning Algorithms. Python, OpenAI Gym, Tensorflow. Exercises and Solutions to accompany Sutton's Book and David Silver's course. 
This repository provides code, exercises and solutions for popular Reinforcement Learning algorithms. These are meant to serve as a learning tool to complement the theoretical materials from

Reinforcement Learning: An Introduction (2nd Edition)
David Silver's Reinforcement Learning Course
Each folder in corresponds to one or more chapters of the above textbook and/or course. In addition to exercises and solution, each folder also contains a list of learning goals, a brief concept summary, and links to the relevant readings.

All code is written in Python 3 and uses RL environments from OpenAI Gym. Advanced techniques use Tensorflow for neural network implementations.
